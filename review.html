    <h1>1.Problem Description</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>
      This Website is based on drones, it acts as and information site but also a shop as you can see on the trending
      pages. this website offers a hub for the drone communioty to upload video as seen on the blog page where users can
      see others work and accomplishments. This offers a support base where anyone with the tresrest of buying as drone
      or just there to see other peoples work. In this website there are alot of features like js and and animation with
      css, this offer a better experoence for the user to iommerse the user in thinging what will happen next.
    </p>
    <p>
      The use
      of opacity allows for the transparincy of picture and allows for effect that are seen on the about page. This
      website uses a js scroll fade effect with provises information about certain parts of the drone. On thre trending
      page it shows what drone is the best in the market at the moment and it provies the speca and al;so a small bit of
      information too. The page also has a accesorries tablw with can combine with the drone that is trending. The
      contact apge uses a form with a first, second name and email input, these fields are mandatory before submitting
      anuthoing in the form. The conatct container is respnsive just like all the other containers and colums on the
      website it provies a user experinec on mobile too.
    </p>
    <p>
      The use of css animation helped me put the drone that flys into
      frmae and the bklades spin after the drone flys into frame. This isd used to help interact the user wiht the page
      and it allows ther users to remeber the page because of this aniimation. The use of js for the carousel provides a
      seemless transition between images allowing the user to see differnt elemts of drones.
      This website helps to provide information about the mosty trending drone on the market and also a page where users
      can upload work and videos to share to the drone community.

    <h1>2.Research</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>
      As part of my research i looked at differnt pages not only around drones but also around the styling of my webiste
      for insperation.
    </p>
    <img src="assets/images/droneDirect.png">
    <p>
      I got informationn from drones direct to hel;p me make the layoutn of the trending page with the css dropdown
      with the stats and also a recommended product table. I quite like the design of thye page as it is very infomative
      but also i kpet mile looking clean wiothe hover dropdown as this has a better look to tie into my website. I used
      font awesome as icons to put into my dropdown as i think it looks better rather than a css tick.
    </p>
    <img src="assets/images/firewatch.png">
    <p>
      I got informatrion from this site for the use of its js, this gave me the insperatrion to have a scroll fade
      effect implamented on my index page to help bring information in a less boring way. I feel that the better the
      feasture of the ewebsite the more the user will come back and use and reccomend the website. I used a row with 3
      coplumns the center for the image and the two outside ones for inforrmation on the image in the center. I
      personally think this looks better but for the future i would like the image in the center to be bigger and the
      text fade down into the image to have more of teh apple parralx scroll efffect.
    </p>
    <img src="assets/images/youtubesect.png">
    <p>
      For my blog page i got insperatrion from youtube with the payout of the video cards, i fel that the way i done it
      allows fopr a small decription to be added to the card before the user clicks to play the video. The video due to
      it being in an iframe itr allows the user to watch on the actual webiste page itself rather than having to click
      into youtube. I used css to create a user profile picture to put on each cartd to show what user uploaded what
      just like youtube. This page is build very clean so that its easy to navigate and use thta all people can use the
      page.

    <h1>3.Technology Selection and Site Architecture</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>
      On every page each sectiona nd part you see has been adjusted for use on differnt media devices. A fecture that
      the macbook has is that it allows the webiet to be viewd in differnt sizes. This is helpful to see what it is like
      on smaller screens. The rows in website turn to columns in smaller screen sizes to allow a better viewer
      experience. The use of css allows that a meda tag be places on a particular element so that it can be styled to
      use on differnt media devices.

    <h1>5.Development Plan</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>
      First we start off with the wireframe to get a basic look for the website this alolows me to change as i go along
      to see what looks best in differnt areas
      The index page layout was done first hten the css was added then the js parts, i wanted to go with a large image
      to open up from the website to drasw the users attention to clickl the courasell and then scroll down to the
      effects of the js.
      Then the about page was added, i dont want to put so much design into this as the cards will do the work ans they
      will contain videos insides them. This also contians a largew header image to attarct the users attention.
      Then the contact page is next, i want to create the drone flying across the screen and when the animation is done
      to rotate the blade to look like the drone is hovering. I feel that this will take the longest due to me learning
      the use of the css animations and to delay and make the blades trasparent when the drone is flying onto the
      screen. The contact contaier is happed to look like a box and the shipping sticker for the input for the form. The
      form requires the user to input a first name and second name and a valid email address.
      Then the trending page is made, this will have a clean look as it will be informative to the user with the top
      drone on the market. This page will contain a dropdown with tech specs of the drone and fontawesome icons will be
      used to give the dropdown content more of a style. An accesorries table will be added to give the user a better
      look at products compatable with the trending drone and the price which if the website was a fully funtional a
      inpage product page will open showing the product in more depth.
      Then the blog page is done, this will be made to look like a youtube type page with rows and column of videos. In
      the cards there will be an iframe of a youtube video. I will then amke a userprofile picture to look like the user
      for a more personilised look.

    <h1>6.Testing Plan</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>
      Testing the website i will use the functionality of the macbook to chnage to size of the screen to have alook at
      waht it will look like on other media devices. In my css i will have media quirys to display content in differnt
      wasy on differnt screens and help give the best user experience possible. Also i will drag the webite to expand
      and contract it to see what it will look like on different instances.
    </p>

    <h1>7.Site Evaluation</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>
      I will evalue the website on rensponivness, design, use of css, use of js, content quality, customisation.
    </p>
    <h3>Rensponivness</h3>
    <p>
      In my website i have very good responsivness in differnt browsers and the media displayu is very good in differnt
      screen sizes. It could be improves in differnt areas like teh drone animation and the bloades to make it look more
      reponsive as it was the first tiem doing it there is always more room of improvement.
    </p>
    <h3>Use of CSS</h3>
    <p>
      There is a great range of css use for eah element of the webiste like the page break was a very good idea to reuse
      code as this could be appiled to everypage to split differnt Elements. The use of styling has made the webiste
      look very professinal but small areas to improve on is use padding more around boxes, text and titles as this will
      allow for a better box model evaluation.
    </p>
    <h3>Use of JS</h3>
    <p>
      There is three pieces of js in the website, the code used is not the best but can be improved as this has been the
      first project i ahve it fully implamented and working. I would have liked to use it more in differnt areas in the
      website for a parralx effect.
    </p>
    <h3>Content Quality</h3>
    <p>
      The information present in the website is informative for the parts of the drone, i would have liked to add more
      sections on the index page allowing me to enable more information and more insight into the drone software and the
      coding aspect of it.
    </p>
    <h3>Design</h3>
    <p>
      the overall deisgn is very futeristiuc with balck as the prinmary theme, this theme is projected towards users who
      like this theme which gives a sense of indugence. The design if promoted by the use of its animations and js which
      ties to the theme of fucturistic.
      As this webiste is about drones i added a flying drone to the contact page for the user to remember this site and
      the purpose of the page

              Idea
              - Drone Website

              This website will incorporate services fro drones and more of what the future will hold for them.
              -the website will incorporate an interactive drone to which when hover you can learn about the different
              sections of the drone e.g. the motors, esc, flight controller and more. This will provide a more
              interesting learning and informative website. The time will be dark as a futuristic element will be
              present through the website.
              The use of video to image what the future will look like and how it will shape our lives. This allows for
              an understanding and informative approach to learning about drones.
              - the use of js will show an animation on entering the site and the use of a parallax zoom and scroll
              effect as the user scrolls through the different sections of the web site

            <h3>Logbook 2</h3>
            <p>
              From the last submission of the website log, I have drawn out the template and the sections on each page.
              This is only a rough draft as I will add more in the future. The java scripty elements have been chosen as
              a zoom into the pages images as the pages will be cut into sections. The fist page will contain a carassel
              so research will be needled to understand the element. The nav will be interactive so when scrolling it
              will follow the pages as it will be scrolled. The theme of the pages will be dark as the futuristic
              element is prone to the theme of the topic.

            <h3>Logbook 3</h3>
            <p>
              This week I started the process of adding the basic skeleton of each page to get a feel of what everything
              will look like as if the website was fully done. Some changes around the carousel had been made as the
              lecture this week showed me how I could uses js to switch from picture to picture and I feel I could use
              that as a way to have my carousel. I want to go for a minimal look but have js as an element around the
              whole website.

            <h3>Logbook 4</h3>
            <p>
              This week I had started to create the contact page. For the contact page I started to create a box
              template with a container for the postage details to make it look like a parcel that you would receive
              in the mail. I added place holder text to guide the customer to fill out details and a responsive
              message form. I also started to construct the products page with individual boxes to allow to place
              products in. A js script will be used to make the boxes more responsive with them appearing from off the
              page and disappear when scrolling.

            <h3>Logbook 5</h3>
            <p>
              During this week I made my home page into sections and added a scroll effect with css for when it gets
              to a certain point in the section it scrolls down to fit to the users needs. This allows the page to
              look like it look like it had multiple parts that were interactive. I also added my product boxes to
              fade in on scroll with js. More development has been done on the contact page as I have started the js
              with the drone to fly onto the page to make it look like it was picking up the contact box.
